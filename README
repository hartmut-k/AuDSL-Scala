AuDSL is a Domain Specific Language for hierarchical state machines "Harel statecharts".
See OBJEKTspektrum 4/2011 for concepts, overview and description.

The textual AuDSL allows effortless formulation of arbitrary complex machines 
and allows for a stateless program to simulate or use such a machine.

While the original implementation is in Pharo Smalltalk using PetitParser
(see squeaksource.com -> AuDSL3 -> DSL for Harel statecharts (Pharo edition) ) 
this implementation uses scala parser combinators and comes as a Scala Trait.

Thus it can easily be inherited by your Scala class (and that in turn used by your Java program)

The most astonishing fact is its size:
- the whole grammar plus all glue-to-the-app code is 64 LOC
- the semantic model (from which the DSL text generates the running program) is 180 LOC

Of course there is more test code (435 LOC) than operating code (244 LOC), see loc.txt in AuDSLTest

Want to know what it looks like? Here is the specification of the ubiquitous micro wave oven:

  (r: oven
  	(heater
		(idle
			onEntry:	[enableTimeSetting]
			onExit:  	[disableTimeSetting]
			start [doorIsClosed ] -> cooking )
		(cooking
			onEntry:	[startTimer]
			onExit: 	[stopTimer]
			open -> idle
			finish -> idle ) )
	(door
		history
		(open
			close -> closed )
		(closed
			open -> open) ) )

Your main program only implements the guards and actions (in square brackets), 
for an example see AuDSLOvenTest.scala in package AuDSLTest
